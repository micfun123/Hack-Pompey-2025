# Ahoy world!

Ahoy there! We're `Ahoy world!` and we're here to present our project. It calculates the direction and distance of pm25, pm10 and pm1 particles in the air that is released from the port based on the wind direction and distance at a specific time and date. The project uses a guassian plume model to calculate the dispersion of these particles in the air. The project is implemented in Python and uses nampy, matplotlib and pandas to calculate the results.
